I had the opportunity to speak at the Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE) on modernizing systems observability with AI and Large Language Models. The session explored how organizations can leverage AI and LLMs to enhance their observability practices, moving beyond traditional metrics and logs to gain deeper insights into complex systems.

## Key topics covered:

- The evolution of observability in modern systems
- How AI and LLMs are transforming the analysis of observability data
- Practical applications for using AI to detect anomalies and predict issues
- Implementation strategies for organizations looking to modernize their observability stack
- Open source tools and frameworks that support AI-enhanced observability

The presentation was well-received by attendees interested in the intersection of AI and systems operations.
