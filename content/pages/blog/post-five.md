Chasing community growth by inflating numbers is a tempting trap. It feels good to report skyrocketing user counts, thousands of Slack sign-ups, or impressive Discord memberships. But here’s the hard truth: a massive community that’s disengaged is just an empty room. Developer Relations (DevRel) isn’t about headcount—it’s about building genuine, meaningful relationships with developers who actively engage, contribute, and grow with your product.

Authentic communities are built on trust, shared purpose, and mutual value. That means focusing on quality interactions over mass outreach. Are developers finding value in your documentation? Are they excited to contribute feedback or code? Are they helping each other solve real-world problems? These are the signals of a healthy, thriving community.

Growth for the sake of growth leads to noise. Prioritizing authenticity fosters advocates, not just users. It’s better to have 100 engaged developers who love your product than 10,000 who don’t care. Sustainable community building is about nurturing connections, listening to feedback, and creating safe spaces where developers feel heard and empowered.

So stop chasing vanity metrics. Focus on crafting genuine experiences, and the right kind of growth will follow.
