Let’s be honest—stickers, T-shirts, and swag are fun, but they’re not what keeps developers coming back. Developer Relations (DevRel) isn’t about handing out cool merch; it’s about creating meaningful experiences that leave a lasting impact. Swag might attract attention, but authentic engagement turns developers into advocates.

So, how do you go beyond swag? Start by solving real problems. Host workshops that help developers overcome specific challenges, create tutorials that address real-world use cases, and build communities where developers can genuinely connect and collaborate. Empower developers with tools, resources, and opportunities that make them better at what they do.

Meaningful experiences also mean listening—really listening. Engage in conversations, gather feedback, and make developers feel heard. A personalized thank-you or featuring a developer’s project can go much further than any branded hoodie.

Swag should be the cherry on top, not the whole cake. When DevRel focuses on delivering value and fostering authentic relationships, swag becomes a symbol of community—not a substitute for it. Developers don’t stay for the T-shirts—they stay because they feel valued and supported. That’s how lasting communities are built.
