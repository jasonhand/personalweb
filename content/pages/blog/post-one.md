Opinion

Letâ€™s cut through the noise: Developer Relations (DevRel) professionals donâ€™t need to be AI experts, but ignoring AI altogether is a fast track to irrelevance. The rise of AI in developer tools, APIs, and workflows means that DevRel teams canâ€™t afford to treat it like a black box. But hereâ€™s the good newsâ€”you donâ€™t need to build models or memorize the math behind neural networks to be effective. What you need is a working knowledge of how AI integrates into the developer experience and how to explain it in plain, relatable terms.

Understanding AI fundamentalsâ€”how machine learning models are trained, how APIs deliver AI-powered features, and where ethical pitfalls might lurkâ€”is crucial. But itâ€™s equally important to know where to stop. DevRel isnâ€™t about showcasing encyclopedic knowledge; itâ€™s about translating complex tech into actionable insights for developers. The value lies in making AI accessible, not in dazzling people with jargon.

So, the sweet spot? Learn enough AI to understand your product, anticipate developer concerns, and create meaningful content. Recognize when to lean on data scientists for the deep dives and focus instead on being the bridge between innovation and usability. AI is moving fast, and DevRel needs to move with itâ€”not behind it and definitely not under it.
