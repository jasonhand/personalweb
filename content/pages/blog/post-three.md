It‚Äôs time to have an honest conversation about how Developer Relations (DevRel) measures success. Too often, teams are pressured to justify their value with surface-level metrics‚Äîconference talks given, blog posts published, or Twitter followers gained. But here‚Äôs the truth: none of those numbers matter if they don‚Äôt drive meaningful outcomes for the developer community or the product.

DevRel should be about impact, not activity. Did your talk inspire developers to solve real problems with your product? Did your tutorial reduce friction in onboarding? Did your engagement spark meaningful feedback that led to better features? These are the outcomes that truly matter. Vanity metrics might look good on a quarterly report, but they don‚Äôt reflect whether DevRel is making a difference.

Focusing on outcomes means shifting from ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù to ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù It requires aligning with product and engineering teams to ensure that community insights lead to product improvements. It means building programs that empower developers to succeed, not just tracking how many people clicked on a link. Measuring DevRel success through outcomes isn‚Äôt just more meaningful‚Äîit‚Äôs essential for building trust with leadership and creating lasting value for the developer community.

Chasing numbers is easy. Driving real impact? That‚Äôs the hard part‚Äîand exactly where DevRel should focus.
