Every Developer Relations (DevRel) team eventually faces the question: Should we build our own tools to engage developers or leverage existing solutions? The answer isn’t always clear-cut. Building custom tools can give your team the exact functionality you need and showcase your product’s strengths. But maintenance costs add up fast. Sometimes, the smarter move is to partner with established platforms that already serve the community well.

Custom tools can be powerful when they solve a unique problem your developer audience faces. If you’re showcasing an API, a bespoke demo can highlight its capabilities better than any off-the-shelf solution. But building tools for things like community chat, documentation, or feedback collection? That’s often reinventing the wheel.

The trick is knowing when to build and when to borrow. Build when it directly advances your product’s story or solves a pain point. Borrow when your focus should be on fostering engagement, not managing infrastructure. DevRel is about delivering value—not maintaining custom tools just for the sake of it. Be strategic, stay lean, and invest where it matters most.
