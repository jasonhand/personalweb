AI in security is still in its early days, and I see a lot of the same foundational models being used over and over again with minor tweaks. That means many of these tools share the same weaknesses.

I keep hearing two extremes: "AI will change everything!" vs. "AI is all hype!" The truth? Somewhere in the middle. AI isn’t replacing security teams—it’s an assistant. It speeds up how we find and respond to threats, but humans still have to set the rules and make the critical decisions.

Bottom line: AI is powerful, but only as good as the data it’s trained on and the oversight behind it. If we treat it like magic, we’re going to be disappointed. If we treat it like a tool, we can actually get some real value out of it.
