  If you’re using AI in security, the most important thing isn’t which tool you pick—it’s how you observe and manage it. That means tracking what data goes in, how the model behaves, and what decisions it’s making.

If you’re using AI in security, the most important thing isn’t which tool you pick—it’s how you observe and manage it. That means tracking what data goes in, how the model behaves, and what decisions it’s making.

AI security isn’t just about stopping threats; it’s about making sure the AI itself is trustworthy. And that means setting up policies that evolve alongside AI, not just locking things down and calling it good.

I don’t buy into the idea that AI is going to replace engineers. If anything, it’s creating a whole new field: AI security and observability. The companies that figure this out early are going to be way ahead of the curve.
