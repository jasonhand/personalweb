### AI in Security – We’re Just Getting Started

I don’t think we’ve even begun to tap into AI’s full potential in security. Right now, it’s mostly acting as a force multiplier—helping humans do their jobs faster, not replacing them. AI tools are great for vulnerability management, generating security reports, and even reasoning through complex configurations.

But let’s be real—security isn’t just about throwing tools at problems. It’s about understanding what’s happening under the hood. AI can analyze logs and detect threats, but if we don’t know how or why it’s making decisions, we’re flying blind.

We’re in a technical renaissance where AI is more accessible than ever. The challenge isn’t whether AI can help with security—it’s how we integrate it effectively without losing control.
