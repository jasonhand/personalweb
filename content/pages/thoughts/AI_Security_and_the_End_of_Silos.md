One of the most interesting things about AI in security is how it’s bringing different teams together. Security, IT Ops, and Data teams all have a role to play, and they’re starting to realize they need each other more than ever.

Security teams understand threats and risk. IT Ops knows how to keep systems reliable. Data teams know how AI actually works under the hood. AI-driven security incidents aren’t just a "security problem"—they require expertise from all three groups.

Maybe AI is finally going to force us to break down the silos that have existed for years. If nothing else, it’s making it clear that security, reliability, and AI governance all need to work together. And if businesses don’t adapt, they’re going to struggle to keep up.
