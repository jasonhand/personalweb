Every Developer Relations (DevRel) professional faces the classic dilemma: should you focus on building your own presence on the conference stage, or should you prioritize helping your engineering team get into the spotlight? Here’s the truth—it’s not an either-or situation. A successful DevRel strategy requires a thoughtful balance between both. Speaking at events establishes credibility and visibility for the product and the company, but empowering engineers to share their expertise fosters authenticity and scales your outreach far beyond what any single individual can achieve.

When DevRel professionals monopolize the stage, they risk creating a bottleneck where the company’s voice is limited to a few individuals. Conversely, pushing engineers into speaking roles without support can lead to burnout or poorly delivered talks. The sweet spot? Lead by example but mentor deliberately. Share your own experiences while providing engineers with resources, coaching, and opportunities to speak on topics they’re passionate about. A thriving DevRel program amplifies diverse voices and builds a culture where speaking is a shared responsibility, not a personal brand exercise.

Ultimately, the goal isn’t about racking up personal speaking gigs or filling every conference slot with your engineers. It’s about building sustainable, authentic advocacy for your technology. Speak when it makes sense, support when it empowers, and always aim to scale impact beyond yourself.
